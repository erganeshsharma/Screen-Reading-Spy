Spying System using Screenshot facility :

Spying System will be of great use in various sector, including the home use PC, to a coorporate workstation. It is a kind of spying system, where the program upon starting will send the screenshots of the host PC to the registered email id from time to time, without letting the host user know about this.
So in this way the emailed person will come to know about what is going on, in those PC at what time.
This will be of great use for the parents also to monitor their children's activity and all and for the coorporate sector also to monitor on the workers during work hour.

2. Enter the destination email address, which will going to receive all the mails along with the screenshot attachment from time to time.
3. Set the interval and the number of times, you want to spy on that PC.
